Tower Control controls aircraft on the runway
and in the controlled airspace immediately surrounding the airport. Tower controllers may use radar
to locate an aircraft's position in three-dimensional space, or they may rely on pilot position reports

and visual observation. They coordinate the sequencing of aircraft in the traffic pattern and direct
aircraft on how to safely join and leave the circuit. Aircraft which are only passing through the
airspace must also contact Tower Control in order to be sure that they remain clear of other traffic.
